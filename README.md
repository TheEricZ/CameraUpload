# CameraUpload

This is the code that is meant for allowing photos to be taken through the app. It also 
grants the app permission to access photos from the gallery that can then be uploaded to the app.

There are some errors as of right now but most of the code is there and I believe there are only
some minor tweaks to be made.

Building and running the code uses the same steps as the main repository.
