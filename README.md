# CameraUpload

This is the code that is meant for allowing photos to be taken through the app. It also 
grants the app permission to access photos from the gallery that can then be uploaded to the app.

There are some errors as of right now but most of the code is there and I believe there are only
some minor tweaks to be made.

The code is only here for now while some mistakes are being fixed. Eventually this will be merged into the
main repository. This code is not meant to be run separately without the rest of the app.
